title: About
---
Welcome to my website. I am a composer/musician/performer/artist and all round music lover based in Dublin, Ireland. I have been writing music for over 25 years and have been greatly inspired by living in such places as Berlin, Bamberg, London, York, Paris and Dublin. In general my music stems from the electro-acoustic world and its core technique is based on the practices of musique concrète. Over the years this has expanded and been influenced by more improvised and instrumental territories derived from a deep exploration of instrumental timbre through collaborative projects with a large number of solo musicians. My music has been distinguished by its richly textural qualities and meticulous layering techniques. A key part of my creative process involves recording and manipulating acoustic sounds, blending both traditional and extended instrumental techniques. In recent years, my compositional approach has evolved toward a more tonal language, placing greater emphasis on beauty and emotional expression in both the acoustic and electro-acoustic domain. My compositions often tell stories that reflect the current state of the world. 

Releases:
- In 2022 I released a new EP **Wildwood** for solo cello. This is a cello suite I wrote for Martin Johnson (principle cellist of the National Symphony Orchestra and member of Concorde) with the aid of an Arts Council bursary. 
- With another side of my writing I released an EP of four songs in 2017 called **The Ring Lieder** - on poems by Roderick Ford - on which I have explored the world of setting poetry to song. 
- My debut album **What Was** is on [Ergodos](https://ergodos.bandcamp.com) records and features a selection of solo, duo and trio works with and without electronics. You can listen to all three albums here: [LISTEN](/listen)

For 3 years Laura Hyland and myself ran a bi-monthly night called Listen at Lilliput at Lilliput Press in Stoneybatter, Dublin. This was a platform for musicians, composers and soundartists of all descriptions to showcase new and old work in an intimate and sympathetic listening environment.

After completing my PhD by composition at the University of York, UK in 2009 I returned to Ireland to re-establish myself on the Irish music scene. Since then I have expanded my musical output by writing for theatre (OFF PLAN by Simon Doyle), putting together a multidisciplinary festival called Sensorium with two colleagues of mine from York, Angie Atmadjaja and Emily Kalies (as The-Link-Project) and being a band member of Clang Sayne and vocal trio Silver Kites.

Currently teaching composition at Trinity College Dublin and the Royal Irish Academy of Music.
