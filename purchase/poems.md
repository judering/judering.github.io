## The Old Train

A chain of days puffs from the old smoke stack <br>
of a train that barely makes it up the hill,<br>
and love sits beside me in a third-class seat,<br>
while dreams nod in a corner on their own,<br>
and soul is working somewhere out of sight.<br>
Then I think there’s nowhere else I’d rather be,<br>
than on a train that leaves from what I know,<br>
through the undiscovered landscapes of a life,<br>
to that place we all must go to down the line.<br>

As the sun comes tumbling down towards the dark, <br>
the carriages are a flock of golden lights,<br>
and the last points chatter slow as we pull in<br>
to the shadow-casting city in its rose. <br>
The ancient wheels drum-roll us up the platform,<br>
as the old train draws wheezing to a stop<br>
and I hear the engine gasp and then grow quiet.<br>
Then soul steps off to do the thing that souls do,<br>
as we others spot you watching by the gate,<br>
where you’ve waited all these years to take us home.<br>

## Amber

Insects dream in their vaults of amber<br>
around her parchment neck.<br>
The atmosphere has preserved her<br>
for nearly three hundred years.<br>
<br>
She lies on her shelf as one asleep,<br>
lonely in her ancient lace.<br>
I think of lilies growing on dark waters,<br>
petals closed for night;<br>
<br>
see myself as a pallid stranger,<br>
intruding suddenly at her side,<br>
in her chamber under the earth<br>
of a monastery garden shrill with birds,<br>
<br>
set in a curve of summer day.<br>
The dreamer is inside<br>
the dream, but the dream<br>
is inside the dreamer.<br>

## The Sylph

I sit on a flat stone by the lake<br>
and drink rough wine.<br>
<br>
My bare feet dabble in the cool sky,<br>
the wild clouds far below<br>
<br>
All the thousand greens of pines<br>
and reeds are a double<br>
<br>
ring around this hourglass day.<br>
Then a breeze shoves through the reeds,<br>
<br>
the ruffles of its swaying skirts <br>
twirl the falling world away.<br>
<br>
Upward wings a shrieking disc of birds,<br>
I pour the wine from cup to stone,<br>
<br>
the sunlight walks across the lake in stars<br>
and falls upon my singing flesh.<br>

## A Plate of Holes

It’s nothing, just a plate of holes,<br>
standing on a disc of lace,<br>
their yellows, greens and russet reds,<br>
their scents of breezes and the sun:<br>
they wait there quiet as unborn souls,<br>
unheard music, tears unshed.<br>
<br>
And I sit still before the plate<br>
and think of how I miss you love:<br>
those times before I laid you down,<br>
before the world was full of holes.<br>
<br>
Remember all the plans we had,<br>
the promises I made you:<br>
those pearls still lie below the sea<br>
and dream forever in their shells.<br>
