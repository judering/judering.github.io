GONE
– a video and sound installation project I made while on a residency at Akademie der Künste, Berlin’s Sommerakademie in 2003.

I spent two weeks hanging around a deserted, derelict factory in Rüdersdorf, Brandenburg, on the outskirts of Berlin. It was  a desolate place, completely abandoned and it’s former function lost….gone….
It was a strange place to work and create a project but I found it visually stunning and so borrowed a video camera and started shooting everyday.
This particular building caught my attention. I had to climb up a ladder to get into the space but each day there was a different lighting effect happening on the walls. It was also intensely quiet there so I made some recordings of found objects being thrown around within the space and elements being disturbed.
This piece was exhibited in Rüdersdorf at the end of my residency alongside several other artists work and again at Akademie der Künste in Berlin as part of the Junge Akademie exhibition in 2003/4.

Interference Fabrik from Judith Ring on Vimeo.
This is some raw footage I shot on the grounds of the factory while on the residency as part of Akademie der Künste’s sommerakademie in 2003.
For this video I have added a piece I wrote while working at the ADK studios in Berlin to the raw footage to help bring it to life.
This is not a piece of video art. It is simply some fascinating footage of a profoundly beautiful derelict factory that I thought I would share. To me every shot is a work of art. A feast for the eyes.
It is unedited and should be viewed from a purely observational point of view. A lot of clarity has been lost in the compression process but hopefully it will give some impression of my experience.
