Welcome to my website. I am a composer/musician/performer/artist and all round music lover based in Dublin, Ireland. I have been writing music for over 20 years and have been greatly inspired by living in such places as Berlin, London, York, Paris and Dublin. In general my music stems from the electro-acoustic world and its core technique is based on the practices of musique concrète. Over the years this has expanded and been influenced by more improvised and instrumental territories derived from a deep exploration of instrumental timbre through collaborative projects with a large number of solo musicians. 

In 2022 I released a new EP **Wildwood** for solo cello. This is a cello suite I wrote for Martin Johnson (principle cellist of the National Symphony Orchestra and member of Concorde) with the aid of an Arts Council bursary. With another side of my writing I released an EP of four songs in 2017 called **The Ring Lieder** - on poems by Roderick Ford - on which I have explored the world of setting poetry to song. My debut album **What Was** is on [Ergodos](https://ergodos.bandcamp.com) records and features a selection of solo, duo and trio works with and without electronics. You can listen to all three albums here: [LISTEN](/listen)

My work is deeply textural and developed through complex layering techniques. For the most part each piece is highly collaborative as I work closely with musicians to find out what their instruments can do. Over the years I have recorded a wide range of instruments from the standard orchestral choices to the Ondes Martenot and adapted viola. Each player offers something new to the mix and so each piece is unique to the player(s) involved.

Over the years my work has been performed by numerous orchestras and ensembles in Europe and North America including the National Symphony Orchestra, Concorde ensemble (Ireland), Crash ensemble (Ireland), The Guinness Choir (Ireland), University of York chamber orchestra (UK), Bradyworks (Canada), Percussemble (Germany) and Sepia ensemble (Poland). I have also written for many wonderful musicians such as Christian-Pierre La Marca (cello) + Félicien Brut (accordion), Lina Andonovska (flute), Dermot Dunne (accordion), Kate Ellis (cello), Martin Johnson (cello), Adele Johnson (viola), Malachy Robinson (double bass), Michelle O’Rourke (mezzo soprano), Garth Knox (viola), Natasha Lohan (mezzo soprano), Rolf Hind (piano), Paul Roe (clarinet), Jane O’Leary (piano), Laura Moody (cello), Beau Stocker (percussion), Damien Harron (percussion), Panayiotis Demopoulos (piano), Valerie Pearson (violin), Elisabeth Smalt (adapted viola), Nathalie Forget (Ondes Martenot), Andre Leroux (tenor saxophone) and many more.

For 3 years Laura Hyland and myself ran a bi-monthly night called Listen at Lilliput at Lilliput Press in Stoneybatter, Dublin. This was a platform for musicians, composers and soundartists of all descriptions to showcase new and old work in an intimate and sympathetic listening environment.

After completing my PhD by composition at the University of York, UK in 2009 I returned to Ireland to re-establish myself on the Irish music scene. Since then I have expanded my musical output by writing for theatre (OFF PLAN by Simon Doyle), putting together a multidisciplinary festival called Sensorium with two colleagues of mine from York, Angie Atmadjaja and Emily Kalies (as The-Link-Project) and being a band member of Clang Sayne and vocal trio Silver Kites.
